% MY STORY
\MyStory{
	\footnotesize Born in Montreal, Pierre is French-Canadian. As a young man he left Canada to work in Europe as a journalist, spending time in both France and Switzerland. During 1903, Pierre met a man who would become his best friend, Alex Delacroix, a pioneering photojournalist working for Le Journal de Genève. Alex introduced Pierre to his sister, Marie, and the two soon fell in love, eventually getting married in 1906. The couple settled in Lausanne, Switzerland. From this union, Pierre and Marie had two children: Audrey born in 1909, and Quentin born in 1913.
	
	Then came the war. While Switzerland was neutral, Pierre could not stand idly by while others were being slaughtered. During 1915, as the 1st Canadian Division reached France, Pierre was recruited by British intelligence to use his local knowledge and language skills to pose as a Swiss journalist covering the German side of the conflict. In reality, Pierre was spying for the Allies.

	By 1917, Pierre was at the front lines in Belgium. After acquiring documents detailing a secret German weapon, he arranged to meet with Allied forces at Ypres. Taking heavy fire, Pierre and the squad sent to rendezvous with him, took shelter in a cellar. It was Pierre who first noticed the iron door, inscribed with strange letters and symbols, and the stone steps behind the door, which led down into darkness.
