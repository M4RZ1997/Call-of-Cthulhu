% MY STORY
\MyStory{\scriptsize Haxton loved his job with the Arkham Post Office, walking the delivery routes, meeting people, and providing a service, yet he always felt there was something missing in his life.

	Shortly before his 50th birthday, he saw something strange, while walking past a disused warehouse. On taking a closer look, Haxton was accosted and barely survived an encounter with pack of savage beast-like men. While the physical trauma healed quickly, it took much longer for his mind to recover. After spending seven months in Arkham Sanatorium Haxton was released; the doctors recording that he had made a "full recovery". In truth, he had simply learned to tell the doctors what they wanted to hear.
	
	His time in the sanatorium was not spent in vain; there were others who had survived their own encounters with things that man was not meant to know. These people listened to Haxton's tale and nodded; they knew he was telling the truth. They called themselves Ratched's Children and they said they worked to protect mankind from the horrors of the night. After being released, Haxton kept in contact with Ratched's Children. Eventually, he was offered membership in the fight for mankind's salvation. Haxton had found what he had been looking for all of his life and a way he could make a difference. He now devotes his time to "the project", searching the internet and newspapers for incidents that could be related to the work of the Old Ones. He is vigilant and ready to answer the call when it comes.
