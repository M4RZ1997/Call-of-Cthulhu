% MY STORY
\MyStory{\scriptsize Spurning the harsh Australian lifestyle of his parents, Atkinson moved away and studied at the University of Australia to become a teacher. After receiving his degree, Atkinson moved back to his hometown to teach, where he married and had two children; however, his life was soon to change again.

	Atkinson liked to explore. On one such visit to Blue Lake, something horrible and unexplainable happened. A foul and alien thing emerged from the water, its hideous appendages grabbing Atkinson and pulling him beyond this world. Whether it lasted seconds, hours, or days, Atkinson cannot tell; all that remains of the experience is a series of nightmarish visions in which Atkinson saw the return of the Old Ones and the eventual fate of humanity. At some point, Atkinson awoke on the edge of Cuicocha, a crater lake in the Imbabura Province of Ecuador. He was found raving and taken to the nearest hospital. Finding his wallet, the locals believed that Atkinson was a traveller who had come into difficulty. Eventually the authorities were able to contact his family and arrangements were made to return him to Australia.

	On his return, it was clear that his mind was unhinged - plus there was no real explanation for how he came to be in Ecuador. He was in the care of the Thomas Brentwood Hospital. It was during this time that Atkinson befriended a hospital visitor called Anton, who had also experienced strange visions. Anton said there were others who had experienced strange things and that they belonged to a secret group called Ratched's Children. The group were committed to preventing the return of the Old Ones.

	Since his release, Anton drops by now and again, and the two disappear for weeks at a time. His family believes the two are out, roving the outback.
