% MY STORY
\MyStory{\small Harald was born in Stuckenborstel, a small town near Hamburg, Germany. At an early age his grandfather taught him how to ethically hunt in the nearby forests and swamps - being a kind of warden. He found his first deer shed which he later designed into his treasured necklace.
	
	In his teenage years, however, he was called up by his father to work in the family-owned brewery and with the passing of his grandfather, his once favoured hobby of hunting and surveilling wildlife has become a distant memory.
	
	An adult Harald decided to emigrate to America to build his own brewery in the New World, chasing the promised dreams. However, after World War 1, and as a German immigrant in particular, he needed to foreclose his once profitable brewery in the wake of prohibition. Remembering his fondness of hunting and seeing the lush wilderness near Worcester he built up a hunting preserve which became very frequented by the rich and wealthy.
